# EventEase
A Blazor WebAssembly Application with Models, Components, Service, and Pages. Please see the Models folder to see the objects or model content, Component folder for the component content and definition, Service folder for service content and definition, and the Pages folder for routing and navigation. Please note that the User model and UserList model is for adding attendees and tracking the attendees, I just reuse it on my login session.
